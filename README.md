# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Supermarket Projects

This project was developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, aiming to apply the learned concepts by creating a supermarket simulation. 

The project is divided into two distinct parts:

1.Supermarket with Structs and Dynamic Arrays:

- Utilizes Structs to encapsulate essential elements and Dynamic Arrays for dynamic memory management.
- The source code and related files are contained in the `SuperEDA_Structs_Arrays` folder.

2.Supermarket with Linked Lists and Binary Trees:

- Introduces Linked Lists for dynamic data manipulation and Binary Trees for optimizing specific operations.
- The relevant files for this section are located in the `SuperEDA_LinkedLists_BinaryTrees` folder.

## Consolidated Project

The consolidated project provides a comprehensive view of the techniques used in both parts, offering an understanding of software development with data structures. 

To open the project, use Microsoft Visual Studio and open the corresponding `.sln` file for the desired section.
